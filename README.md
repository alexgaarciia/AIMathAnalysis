# AIMathAnalysis
The main goal of this repository is to evaluate the ability of several LLMs to interpret and respond to prompts with varying levels of specificity, determining whether it requires detailed background context for effective problem-solving or if they can efficiently derive solutions from minimal information.

Feel free to take a look at our findings [here](https://github.com/alexgaarciia/AIMathAnalysis/blob/main/RESULTS.md) or in our paper:
