# ChatGPTWolfram
## Introduction to the repository
The main goal of this repository is to provide information about how to use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) together. In case any of these names seem unfamiliar, let me provide some basic definitions. **ChatGPT** is an AI language model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. **Wolfram Mathematica**, on the other hand, is a computing environment used for mathematical computation, algorithm development, data visualization, and symbolic manipulation, widely used in scientific, engineering, mathematical, and computing fields.
