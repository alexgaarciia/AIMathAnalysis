## Experiments
In order to carry out our goal, we provided some mathematical problems with varying difficulty. To ensure our comparison extends beyond just ChatGPT, we conducted our experiments on Gemini and LLaMA as well. This approach allows us to provide a more comprehensive evaluation by including multiple AI models in our analysis, thereby avoiding any bias that may arise from focusing solely on ChatGPT. By examining the performance and capabilities of Gemini and LLaMA alongside ChatGPT, we aim to achieve a balanced and wide-ranging understanding of the current landscape of conversational AI technologies.

There will be five different sections of evaluations, each corresponding to a different model: ChatGPT-3.5, Wolfram GPT, ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and LLaMA. Inside each evaluation section, we applied two different types of prompting: **Zero-shot** and **Zero-shot-CoT**. For each one, we tested their performance by being very specific about what we wanted to do and by not being specific about what we wanted to do.

That is, for example, instead of asking to solve an integral in a range (specific instructions), we could ask to obtain the area and check if it knows that an integral must be computed (general instructions). With this, we are trying to solve two main questions: Do LLMs require background thinking? How much can we do without being very specific?


## ChatGPT-3.5
### Zero-shot prompting
#### Specific instructions
##### Level 1: Inverting a matrix.
In this case, we will consider a matrix from this PDF: [Inverse Matrices](https://web.viu.ca/pughg/Spring2006/math152S0602/homework8.pdf).
- Prompt:
```ruby
Given the matrix A = [[1, -2, 1], [-2, 3, 1], [5, -7, -3]], find the inverse (A^-1).
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">

</p>

This constitutes another problem that it did not solve correctly. After checking the solutions, we see that the deciphered message should be "FREE PIZZA IN THE CAFETERIA". 

##### Level 17: Calculating the time it takes for an object to cool down to a certain temperature.
- Prompt:
```ruby
A freshly baked pie is taken out of the oven and left to cool in a room. The temperature of the oven was 200ÂºC, and the room temperature is a constant 25ÂºC. When the pie is first taken out, its temperature is 180ÂºC. After 20 minutes, the temperature of the pie drops to 100ÂºC. Calculate the time it takes for the pie to cool down to 50ÂºC.
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-3.5/Zero-shot/General%20instructions/level17.png" width = 600>
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-3.5/Zero-shot/General%20instructions/level17.2.png" width = 600>

</p>

The answer is correct.

##### Level 2: Generating normally distributed variables with a specific mean and variance.

</p>

Even though the answer is correct, we must take something into consideration. If we were to compute the mean and variance of these variables, we will not get the exact mean and variance. This is due to the nature of random sampling from a distribution. This randomness can lead to samples that don't perfectly reflect the underlying distribution, especially with smaller sample sizes.

##### Level 3: Plotting a function.
- Prompt:
```ruby
Plot -3*(x-2)^2-5.
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-on/Zero-shot/Specific%20instructions/level3.png" width = 600>
</p>

The function is correctly plotted.

##### Level 4: Finding a minimum.

</p>

As we have seen in the solutions given by Wolfram Mathematica, we may think the answers are wrong because instead of giving a number, it gives the Lambert W function. However, let's check two things: the solution given by Wolfram Alpha and the graph:

Wolfram Alpha        |  Graph
:-------------------:|:-------------------:
![](https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-on/Zero-shot/Specific%20instructions/Proofs/proof_level5.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-on/Zero-shot/Specific%20instructions/Proofs/proof_level5.2.png)

We can see that the former returns two intersection points. Both are expressed using the Lambert W function; the first intersection point is equal to 3'693 and the second one is 6'936. But in this case, only of the interesection points is correct.

##### Level 6: Deriving a function.
- Prompt:
```ruby
What is the derivative of f(x)=5/(sqrt(3x-1))?

```ruby
The following table shows information regarding the sales of daily press in the year 1998, as the number of daily copies sold per thousand inhabitants in 8 autonomous Spanish regions. The sales are assumed to be related to economic activity levels as measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per inhabitant in thousands of euros (Source: INE. Anuario Estadistico).
GDP 8.3 9.7 10.7 11.7 12.4 15.4 16.3 17.2
Copies sold 57.4 106.8 104.4 131.9 144.6 146.4 177.4 186.9

Use least squares to estimate a simple regression model that explains the number of copies
sold as a function of GDP per capita
```

##### Level 13: Getting the best path from one node to another (requires knowing that Dijkstra's algorithm must be used).
The example from below comes from this pdf: [Fundamental Algorithms 12 - Solution Examples](https://www7.in.tum.de/~kretinsk/teaching/fundamental%20algorithms/fundalg12sol.pdf).

- Prompt:
```ruby
Imagine I have a graph (with nodes s, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, t), whose connections (with weights) are represented with the following adjacency matrix: ((0,1,3,0,0,0,0), (1,0,0,8,4,0,0), (3,0,0,0,3,0,0), (0,8,0,0,0,1,7), (0,4,3,0,0,1,0), (0,0,0,1,1,0,10),(0,0,0,7,0,10,0)). Obtain the shortest path from s to t.
```

- Wolfram Output:

</p>

If we were to check the solutions, we could see that the shortest path will be s, s1, s4, s5, t; contrary to the one obtained by Wolfram (s, s1, s4, s5, s6, t).

##### Level 14: Predicting the next number in a complex sequence (requires recognizing and applying the underlying pattern or mathematical rule governing the sequence).
- Prompt:
```ruby
Consider the following sequence of numbers: 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48, ...Your task is to predict the next number in this sequence.

</p>

This constitutes another problem that it solved correctly. After checking the solutions, we see that the deciphered message is "FREE PIZZA IN THE CAFETERIA". 

##### Level 17: Calculating the time it takes for an object to cool down to a certain temperature (requires the use of Newton's Law of Cooling, which often involves solving differential equations).
- Prompt:
```ruby
A freshly baked pie is taken out of the oven and left to cool in a room. The temperature of the oven was 200ÂºC, and the room temperature is a constant 25ÂºC. When the pie is first taken out, its temperature is 180ÂºC. After 20 minutes, the temperature of the pie drops to 100ÂºC. Calculate the time it takes for the pie to cool down to 50ÂºC.
```

</p>

In this case, the problem is tricky, since we cannot forget about the fact that in order to find the work, we must know the spring constant k. This was successfully taken into account by Wolfram.

##### Level 19: Computing the quantity a company should make for its inventory given production cost, demand rate, and other variables (requires understanding EOQ).
The example from below comes from the following webpage: [Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): Practical Problems and Solutions](https://www.financestrategists.com/accounting/cost-accounting/material-costing/economic-order-quantity-eoq-problems-and-solutions/).

- Prompt:
```ruby
The John Equipment Company estimates its carrying cost at 15% and its ordering cost at $9 per order. The estimated annual requirement is 48,000 units at a price of $4 per unit. What is the most economical number of units to order? How many orders should be placed in a year? How often should an order be placed?
```

- Wolfram Output:

</p>

Wolfram understood that it was an EOQ problem, so it proceeded correctly by using the EOQ formula from below. Plus, the results coincide with the solutions:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-on/Zero-shot/General%20instructions/Proofs/proof_level19.png" width = 300>

##### Level 20: Computing the orbital period (requires knowing Keplerâ€™s third law of planetary motion).
The example from below comes from the following PDF: [Solutions to Physics I Gravity and Keplerâ€™s Laws Practice Problems](https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/anchordoqui/101-P4_s.pdf).

- Prompt:
```ruby
Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has a mean orbital radius of 1.22x109 m. The orbital period of Titan is 15.95 days. Hyperion, another moon of Saturn, orbits at a mean radius of 1.48x109 m. Predict the orbital period of Hyperion in days.
```

- Wolfram Output:
<p align = "center">

</p>

Finally, Wolfram was impressively able to understand that we were dealing with **Kepler's third law**. By checking the correct solution from the PDF above, we see that the same result is obtained: the orbital period of Hyperion is 21.31 days.

##### Conclusions

- Prompt:
```ruby
Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has a mean orbital radius of 1.22x109 m. The orbital period of Titan is 15.95 days. Hyperion, another moon of Saturn, orbits at a mean radius of 1.48x109 m. Predict the orbital period of Hyperion in days.
Let's think step by step.
```

- Wolfram Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-on/Zero-shot-CoT/General%20instructions/level20.png" width = 600>

##### Level 2: Generating normally distributed variables with a specific mean and variance.
- Prompt:
```ruby
Generate several normally distributed variables with mean=45.6 and variance=13.84.
Let's think step by step.
```

- ChatGTP Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level2.png" width = 600>

</p>

If we were to check how ChatGPT generated these values, we can simply click on the analysis button at the end of the answer:
```ruby
# Number of variables to generate
num_variables = 1000

# Generating normally distributed variables
normally_distributed_vars = np.random.normal(mean, standard_deviation, num_variables)
normally_distributed_vars[:10]  # Displaying the first 10 values for reference
```

It used the command `np.random.normal(mean, standard_deviation, num_variables)` from the NumPy library. It generates random numbers based on the normal (Gaussian) distribution. Here's what each parameter means:
1. **mean**: This is the mean (or average) value of the normal distribution. 
2. **standard_deviation**: This is the standard deviation of the normal distribution, which determines how spread out the values are around the mean. 
3. **num_variables**: This parameter specifies the number of random variables you want to generate from this distribution.

For example, if you wanted to generate 5 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, you would use `np.random.normal(0, 1, 5)`. This might give you an array of numbers like `[-0.23, 0.45, 0.68, -1.23, 0.10]`. Each of these numbers is a random draw from a normal distribution centered around 0, with most values falling within one standard deviation (1 in this case) of the mean.

   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level14.2.png" width = 600>
</p>

The underlying sequence was perfectly discovered.

##### Level 15: Calculating the future value of an investment.
The example from below comes from this webpage: [Calculating the Future Value](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/businessfinancialmath/chapter/4-2-calculating-future-value/).

- Prompt:
```ruby
If you invested $5,000 for 10 years at 9% compounded quarterly, how much money would you have? What is the interest earned during the term?
Let's think step by step.
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level15.png" width = 600>
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level15.2.png" width = 600>
</p>

By checking the results, we can see that these coincide with the solutions. Hence, ChatGPT was able to understand that it was a compound interest problem.

##### Level 16: Deciphering a phrase knowing each letter was shifted by a certain number.
The example from below comes from the following PDF: [Caesar Cipher Decoding: Answer Key](https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-hmhco-vmg-craftcms-public/CipherAnswers.pdf).

- Prompt:
```ruby
Decode this phrase "SERR CVMMN VA GUR PNSRGREVN" knowing that each letter was shifted by 13.

   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level16.png" width = 600>
</p>

This constitutes another problem that it solved correctly. After checking the solutions, we see that the deciphered message is "FREE PIZZA IN THE CAFETERIA". 

##### Level 17: Calculating the time it takes for an object to cool down to a certain temperature.
- Prompt:
```ruby
A freshly baked pie is taken out of the oven and left to cool in a room. The temperature of the oven was 200ÂºC, and the room temperature is a constant 25ÂºC. When the pie is first taken out, its temperature is 180ÂºC. After 20 minutes, the temperature of the pie drops to 100ÂºC. Calculate the time it takes for the pie to cool down to 50ÂºC.
Let's think step by step.
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level17.png" width = 600>
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level17.2.png" width = 600>
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level17.3.png" width = 600>
</p>

In this case, ChatGPT was unable to solve this problem. Even though it understood that it was a problem related to Newton's Law of Cooling, it couldn't determine the cooling constant `k`.

##### Level 18: Calculating the work done in compressing a spring.
The example from below comes from the following YouTube video: [Work done by Spring Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUgMK8wQAcU).

- Prompt:
```ruby
A person compresses a spring a distance of 5cm, which requires a force of 100N. How much work does the person do?
Let's think step by step.
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level18.png" width = 600>
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level18.2.png" width = 600>
</p>

In this case, ChatGPT **did not** fail to know that in order to find the work we must know the spring constant K. The result coincides with the solution, giving W=2'5J. 

##### Level 19: Computing the quantity a company should make for its inventory given production cost, demand rate, and other variables.
The example from below comes from the following webpage: [Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): Practical Problems and Solutions](https://www.financestrategists.com/accounting/cost-accounting/material-costing/economic-order-quantity-eoq-problems-and-solutions/).

- Prompt:
```ruby
The John Equipment Company estimates its carrying cost at 15% and its ordering cost at $9 per order. The estimated annual requirement is 48,000 units at a price of $4 per unit. What is the most economical number of units to order? How many orders should be placed in a year? How often should an order be placed?
Let's think step by step.
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level19.png" width = 600>
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level19.2.png" width = 600>
</p>

ChatGPT understood that it was an EOQ problem, so it proceeded correctly by using the EOQ formula from below. However, the answer to the last question (How often should an order be placed?) does not coincide with the solutions.

##### Level 20: Computing the orbital period.
The example from below comes from the following PDF: [Solutions to Physics I Gravity and Keplerâ€™s Laws Practice Problems](https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/anchordoqui/101-P4_s.pdf).

- Prompt:
```ruby
Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has a mean orbital radius of 1.22x109 m. The orbital period of Titan is 15.95 days. Hyperion, another moon of Saturn, orbits at a mean radius of 1.48x109 m. Predict the orbital period of Hyperion in days.
Let's think step by step.
```

- ChatGPT Output:
<p align = "center">
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level20.png" width = 600>
   <img src="https://github.com/alexgaarciia/ChatGPTWolfram/blob/main/images/ChatGPT-4/wolfram-off/Zero-shot-CoT/level20.2.png" width = 600>
</p>

Finally, ChatGPT was again able to understand that we were dealing with Kepler's third law. By checking the solution from the PDF above, we see that the same result is obtained: the orbital period of Hyperion is 21.31 days.

##### Conclusions
In this last part of the project, we have seen that ChatGPT has performed quite well. Nonetheless, we must not forget that it couldn't solve two problems: **Level 17** (Calculating the time it takes for an object to cool down to a certain temperature) and **Level 19** (Computing the quantity a company should make for its inventory given production cost, demand rate, and other variables). Regarding the former, it couldn't get the cooling constant; in the latter, even though it answered two questions correctly, it wasn't able to answer the last one. Overall, 18/20 problems were solved successfully; and for each of them, ChatGPT gave specific steps on how to solve them.

## Experiments with Gemini and LLaMA
To ensure our comparison extends beyond just ChatGPT, we conducted our experiments on Gemini and LLaMA as well. This approach allows us to provide a more comprehensive evaluation by including multiple AI models in our analysis, thereby avoiding any bias that may arise from focusing solely on ChatGPT.

| 19    | Partial/Incorrect solution | Partial/Incorrect Solution | Partial/Incorrect solution | Partial/Incorrect solution |
| 20    | Partial/Incorrect solution | M+S | Partial/Incorrect solution | Partial/Incorrect solution |

Here are some explanations for the results from above:
1. Gemini:
* Zero-shot Prompting:
   * Levels 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 16, 19, 20: Correct methodology, errors in calculations.

   * Level 13: Did not use Dijkstra's algorithm.
   * Level 14: Incorrectly guessed the sequence.
   * Level 17: Did not understand that we were dealing with Newton's Law of Cooling.
   * Level 18: Forgot to consider the spring constant.
 
### Overall Observations
Gemini tends to perform better with ZS-CoT prompting, indicating that providing a structured way to approach the problem helps improve the accuracy of the solutions. This is evident in the consistent improvement from solution-only (S) to methodology+solution (M+S) across various levels when using ZS-CoT.

LLaMA, similarly, shows varied performance across different levels and prompting methods. However, it seems to struggle more consistently than Gemini, especially with zero-shot prompting, where it often provides partial or incorrect solutions.

### Specific insights
1. Error Types:
- Both models exhibit a tendency to provide correct methodologies but falter in the execution, leading to errors in calculations. This suggests that while they can understand the problems conceptually, numerical precision or algorithmic execution is a common stumbling block.
- Gemini's zero-shot prompts frequently led to correct methodologies but included calculation errors, whereas its ZS-CoT prompts showed similar patterns but with occasional complete misses (e.g., forgetting a critical factor like the spring constant).
- LLaMA displayed a broader range of errors, including incorrect methodologies, especially under ZS-CoT prompting. This might indicate challenges in applying chain-of-thought reasoning effectively across all types of problems.

2. Performance by Level:
- Both models showed a decline in performance as the complexity of the problems increased, with levels 4, 5, 6, 12, 16, 19, and 20 frequently resulting in partial or incorrect solutions for both Gemini and LLaMA. This suggests a limit to their current capabilities in handling high-complexity or nuanced problem-solving without explicit guidance.
- Certain levels where Gemini improved from S to M+S under ZS-CoT prompting (e.g., levels 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 20) demonstrate the potential effectiveness of CoT in enhancing problem-solving abilities, particularly in providing complete solutions.

3. Notable Differences:
- Gemini's performance suggests a slightly better grasp on methodologies across a range of problem types, potentially due to differences in training data, model architecture, or both.
- LLaMA's challenges with CoT prompting across various problem types highlight the importance of model-specific tuning or adjustments to improve reasoning capabilities.
